              <p>
                Writing tests is like eating your veggies: it's something everyone knows that they
                should do, but not everyone does. Spearmint provides a simple way to write tests
                that gives you confidence your React application will work in the way your users
                interact with it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Spearmint provides a user-friendly GUI for developers to easily generate tests with a few 
                clicks of a button. It dynamically converts user inputs into executable test code 
                through react-testing-library, jest, supertest, puppeteer, vue-test-utils and axe-core.

                  know that moths are repelled by spearmint?

              <p>
                Spearmint isn't just for React. Write tests for your Redux actions, async functions,
                reducers, or middleware. While you're at it, check out your hooks, context or even
                your endpoints. If you're interested in performance, utilize the Puppeteer module.
                Provide custom mock data and inputs, and you're on your way. You can also leverage the
                <a href='https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core'> Axe-Core </a> testing library
                to verify that your application meets various 
                accessibility standards and guarantees an internet for all. If you're concerned about security, the
                <a href= 'https://github.com/snyk/snyk'> Snyk </a> 
                library has been utilized to ensure your application is up to snuff for various 
                security standards and make sure your app isn't vulnerable to malicious attacks.
              </p>
              <p>
                The latest version of Spearmint has a specific focus on Svelte Testing. If your application is developed with Svelte, Spearmint uses the <a href='https://testing-library.com/docs/svelte-testing-library/intro/'>Svelte-Test</a> to handle it with a fully functional Svelte test generator. 
                {/* add sentence for graphql */}  Also the lastest version of Spearmint includes a focus on GraphQL testing allowing developers whose applications utilize GraphQL the ability to test their endpoints.
